# check

```bash
autorestic check [-b, --backend]  [-a, --all]
```

Cheks if one or more backend are configured properly and initializes them if they are not already.

This is mostly an internal command, but useful to verify if a backend is configured correctly.

```bash
autorestic check -b my-backend
```
